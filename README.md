# TeamTAI - BE Smart Hack 2023

# Project Name: “SkyAI”

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
* How might we give quicker responses to customers with urgent needs?
* How might we personalize our technological customer support and increase trust therein?
* How can we tackle the increasing need for customer support while ensuring airline employees maintain a healthy work-life balance? 

## Project Description 🤯
A personalized AI call center in the American Airlines App built to assist users and answer questions about their flights. SkAI listens and responds to user issues and requests and generates recommendations based on their responses and information. All this allows the customer to get the help they need quickly, releases pressure on airline employees, and improves customer experience.

## Project Value 💰
Our solution will help customers dealing with unexpected cancellations or questions about the flight answer questions about the next steps at the tip of their fingers without visiting a kiosk or calling the center. It helps relieve some of the anxiety around planning flights by providing relevant information about the passengers' itinerary. All this allows the customer to get the help they need quickly, releases pressure on airline employees, and improves customer experience.

## Tech Overview 💻
We used some of the following tools, APIs, and languages to build our solution.
* Twilio API
* Javascript
* React Native
* Dialogflow CX
